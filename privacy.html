    <p>Thank you for using the Ultimate Workout Generator! This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our workout generation and chart creation tools. We want to assure you that we are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information You Provide (User Input)</h2>

        <li>Your experience level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).</li>
        <li>Your preferred training modality or available equipment (e.g., Dumbbells, Bodyweight, Machines, Barbells).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use This Information</h2>
    <p>The information you provide is used solely to generate a customized workout routine tailored to your selections. This process involves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Filtering our internal database of exercises based on your chosen training split, goal, experience level, and equipment.</li>
        <li>Presenting the generated workout to you within your browser.</li>
        <li>Estimating the total workout time based on the selected exercises, sets, reps, and rest times.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Generated Workout Data</h2>
    <p>The workout routines generated by the tool are displayed directly within your web browser. This generated data is not transmitted to our servers or stored by us in any way beyond your current session, unless you choose to utilize the "Copy Workout" or "Download as PDF" features.</p>

    <h2>4. Pasted Workout Data (Workout Chart Generator)</h2>
    <p>If you use the "Workout Chart Generator" feature, you may paste text containing workout information into the provided textarea.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Sanitization:</strong> To ensure the security of this feature, the tool uses a client-side library (`DOMPurify`) to sanitize any text you paste, removing potentially harmful code before processing it for PDF generation.</li>
        <li>The text you paste is only used for the purpose of generating the PDF and is not transmitted to our servers or stored by us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>To enhance your user experience, the Ultimate Workout Generator may utilize your browser's local storage. This local storage may be used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remember your selected preferences (training split, goal, experience level, modality) so they are pre-filled on your next visit.</li>
        <li>Temporarily store the last generated workout for your convenience during the current browsing session.</li>
        <li>Temporarily store the text you paste into the "Workout Chart Generator" while you are actively using that feature.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The data stored in local storage remains on your computer and is not accessed by us.</p>

    <h2>6. No Transmission of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>We want to explicitly state that the information you input into the Ultimate Workout Generator, the generated workout routines, and any text you paste into the Workout Chart Generator <strong>are not transmitted to our servers or shared with any third parties.</strong> All processing of your input and the generation of workouts and PDFs occur locally within your web browser.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention in Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The data stored in your browser's local storage by the Ultimate Workout Generator persists until:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You manually clear your browser's local storage.</li>
        <li>You clear your browser's website data for the domain hosting the Ultimate Workout Generator through your browser settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. User Control Over Local Storage</h2>
    <p>You have control over the data stored in your browser's local storage. You can typically view, manage, and clear local storage through your browser's settings or developer tools. Please refer to your browser's documentation for instructions on how to manage local storage.</p>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Libraries</h2>
    <p>The Ultimate Workout Generator utilizes the following client-side JavaScript libraries to enhance its functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>jspdf</code> and <code>jspdf-autotable</code>: These libraries are used to generate PDF documents locally within your browser when you use the "Download as PDF" feature. They do not transmit your data to their servers.</li>
        <li><code>DOMPurify</code>: This library is used to sanitize text you paste into the "Workout Chart Generator" to prevent potential security risks. It operates locally in your browser and does not transmit your data.</li>
    </ul>
