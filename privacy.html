    <h1>Privacy Policy for Our Fitness and Other Tools</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Date of Last Update - Please Insert Date]</p>

    <p>Thank you for using our range of fitness and other tools! This privacy policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of these tools. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.</p>

    <h2>1. Information You Provide (User Input)</h2>
    <p>When you use our various tools, you may provide different types of information depending on the specific tool. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Selections and preferences for generating customized content (e.g., workout parameters, nutritional goals, shopping criteria).</li>
        <li>Data for logging and tracking activities (e.g., workout details, shopping items, measurements).</li>
        <li>Numerical input for calculations (e.g., calories, percentages, quantities, prices).</li>
        <li>Textual content that you might paste into certain tools for processing (e.g., workout routines).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use This Information</h2>
    <p>The information you provide is used solely for the purpose of delivering the functionality of the specific tool you are using. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Generating customized content based on your selections.</li>
        <li>Facilitating the logging and tracking of your activities.</li>
        <li>Performing calculations based on your input and displaying the results.</li>
        <li>Processing and manipulating text you provide within certain tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Generated and Processed Data</h2>
    <p>The data generated or processed by our tools based on your input is typically displayed directly within your web browser. This data is not transmitted to our servers or stored by us in any way beyond your current session, unless a tool explicitly offers features like saving, copying, or downloading.</p>

    <h2>4. Pasted Data (in Certain Tools)</h2>
    <p>Some of our tools may allow you to paste text for processing or analysis. In such cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Sanitization:</strong> To enhance security, these tools may utilize client-side libraries (like <code>DOMPurify</code>) to sanitize any pasted text, removing potentially harmful code before processing.</li>
        <li>The text you paste is only used for the intended functionality of that specific tool and is not transmitted to our servers or stored by us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>To improve your user experience, some of our tools may utilize your browser's local storage. This local storage may be used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remember your selected preferences and settings for a tool so they are pre-filled on your next visit.</li>
        <li>Temporarily store data relevant to your current session for ease of use.</li>
        <li>Persist data that you explicitly choose to save within certain logging tools.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The data stored in local storage remains on your computer and is not accessed by us.</p>

    <h2>6. No Transmission of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>We want to emphasize that the information you input into our tools, the data generated or processed by them, and any text you paste <strong>are generally not transmitted to our servers or shared with any third parties</strong>, unless explicitly stated within the description of a specific tool (which currently is not the case for our described tools). The majority of the processing occurs locally within your web browser.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention in Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The data stored in your browser's local storage by our tools persists until:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You manually clear your browser's local storage.</li>
        <li>You clear your browser's website data for the domain hosting our tools through your browser settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. User Control Over Local Storage</h2>
    <p>You have control over the data stored in your browser's local storage. You can typically view, manage, and clear local storage through your browser's settings or developer tools. Please refer to your browser's documentation for instructions on how to manage local storage.</p>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Libraries</h2>
    <p>Our tools utilize the following client-side JavaScript libraries to enhance their functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Libraries for PDF generation (e.g., <code>jspdf</code>, <code>jspdf-autotable</code>): These are used to generate PDF documents locally within your browser when you use a "download as PDF" feature. They do not transmit your data to their servers.</li>
        <li>Libraries for input sanitization (e.g., <code>DOMPurify</code>): These are used to sanitize user-provided text within certain tools to prevent potential security risks. They operate locally in your browser and do not transmit your data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Automatically Collected Information</h2>
    <p>We may collect anonymous usage data to understand how our tools are used and to improve them. This data is aggregated and does not typically identify individual users. We may also collect standard technical information such as browser type and operating system for ensuring compatibility.</p>

    <h2>11. Cookies</h2>
    <p>We may use cookies for basic website functionality, such as remembering if you've acknowledged a cookie banner. We do not use cookies for tracking across other websites or for advertising.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p>
